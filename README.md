# Send/Receive strings over Serial Communication

This project was done in order to understand **Serial Communication**.

Send and Recieve `string`s over serial communication by **converting** the `string` to `byte array`, **sending** it over the `com`, **catching** the `bytes` and **converting** them back to a `string`.

*:children_crossing: **Disclaimer**: In this project I have used* `Virtual Serial Port Driver` *to emulate the ports on my computer.*
