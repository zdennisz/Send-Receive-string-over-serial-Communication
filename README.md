# Send/Receive strings over Serial Communication

This project was done in order to understand **Serial Communication**.

Send and Recieve `string`'s over serial communication is done by:

- **Converting** the `string` to `byte array`.

- **Sending** it over the `com`.

- **Catching** the `bytes` & **converting** them back to a `string`.
