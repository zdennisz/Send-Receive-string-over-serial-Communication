# Send/Receive strings over Serial Communication
This project was done in order to understand Serial Communication.
Send and Recieve strings over serial communication by converting the string to byte array and sending it over the com and catching the bytes and converting them back to a string.

( I have used Virtual Serial Port Driver to emulate the ports on my comp)
